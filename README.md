The Learning Management System (LMS) used by the [Tech Academy]() leads hundreds of students around the globe through a computer programming course that helps them unlock new career opportunities. A feature to increase the interactivity of student question and response sessions was scoped and created using the [React Drag n Drop](https://react-dnd.github.io/react-dnd/) API.

This demo was created with `create-react-app`

To run the demo:
In a node.js terminal, navigate to the main repository directory and enter `npm install` then `npm start`

All application state is handled through the Question component. State managers like Redux may require a different pattern.
